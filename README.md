## PyYou

PyYou is a desktop application for downloading videos and playlists from YouTube. For writing the program we used python 3.10.5, with the PyTube and tKinter modules. The app was developed in 1 day of work. In the future there will be provable updates, such as 100% graphics support for MacOS and additional features in the app.
